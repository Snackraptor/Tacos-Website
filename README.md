## Purpose

> This website was developed in my COMP1006 Intro to Web Programming course at Georgian College. I was asked to create a website based on my interests, so I chose ............... This website implements CRUD functionalities, register/login pages, securing pages via authentication, search and sort features and APIs.

## Technologies Learned

- PHP
- mySQL
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript

## Launch

- Visit [my project's website](https://lamp.computerstudi.es/~Lionel200390096/COMP%201006/Website1/taco-login.php) and feel free to register/login to play around

To launch this, you'll have to clone my Github files to your PHP server, change the credentials listed in db_cred.php, and run my .sql scripts in your mysql database.
